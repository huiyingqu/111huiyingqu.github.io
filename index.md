# Greeting

My name is Huiying Qu. I am a data analyst/business intelligence analyst with two year working experience. I am currently working at Daasity, a data consulting company, where I take responsibilities working with E-commerce clients to help them understand KPI performance, marketing channel acquisition, customer LTV, and customer retention, and email analytics. I also work closely with engineer team to review API documents, understand how source data is stored and develop strategies to retrieve and load data into our database. I am personally very enthusiastic about utilizing data to drive business decisions and it can add huge values to any organizations.
